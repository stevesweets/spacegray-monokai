# Monokai for Spacegray Eighties

Designed to be used in conjunction with spacegrey eighties.

Love the spacegray theme, but found myself longing for the monokai colours. Some exactly the same as orig monokai, some differences - at least three mistakes. Work in progress, please feel free to fix and fork.

Have not looked into how to send this to package control - so manually pop this in your user/sublimelinter folder after installing spacegrey eighties.

#### My Sublime Settings for Spacegray; as a sidenote, I really do suggest source code pro light for coders - its lovely.

```json
{
  "color_scheme": "Packages/User/SublimeLinter/base16-eighties.monokai (SL).tmTheme",
  "font_face": "Source Code Pro Light",
  "font_options":
  [
    "no_round" // osx only
  ],
  "font_size": 11,
  "theme": "Spacegray Eighties.sublime-theme"
}

```
